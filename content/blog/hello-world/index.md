What to do when you've been blogging on Medium for a while? Start something new.

I've been writing infrequently on Medium for a couple of years now and it has
been great to avoid the maintainance associated with running your own blog.

No temptation to make the software better, all I could do was write.

I'm keen to get a feel for Gatsby, so this is an opportunity to give it a spin.
